      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="p">
          The site was created as a web development assignment in the first TCA.
          The overall objective of the project was to create and develop a
          full-fledged, multi-page website using only HTML and CSS.
          The site serves as a personal portfolio and demonstrates my knowledge
          of basic web development principles such as semantic HTML, layout
          design, responsive design, and version control using GitHub.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          The website includes all the required pages mentioned in the assignment
          brief: Home, Projects, Contact, Video Demo, and Site Report.
          Each page has a clear purpose and follows a consistent visual design.
          This project helped me understand how professional websites are structured
          and how design and usability play an important role in web development.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Planning and Structure</h2>
        <p class="p">
          Before starting the development, I carefully reviewed the assignment
          requirements and planned the overall structure of the website.
          I decided to keep the navigation consistent across all pages so users
          could move easily between sections.
        </p>

        <p class="p">The general structure of each page follows this layout:</p>
        <ul class="p">
          <li>Header with navigation</li>
          <li>Main content area</li>
          <li>Footer</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="p">
          Semantic HTML elements such as
          <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and
          <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>
          were used to improve accessibility, readability, and maintainability.
          This follows the best practices taught during the module.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          The Home page introduces me and the purpose of the website.
          The Projects page lists my areas of interest and includes project templates.
          The Video Demo page contains an embedded video demonstration of the website,
          while the Site Report page documents the development process and reflections.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr class="hr">

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Design Choices</h2>
        <p class="p">
          The website was designed to be clean, modern, and professional.
          I aimed to keep the layout spacious and easy to read rather than crowded.
          The Home page features a large hero section with a background image
          to immediately attract the user’s attention.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          The tagline “We Take and We Make” was kept simple and visually emphasized
          to match the overall theme of the site.
          Consistent typography, spacing, and colours were used across all pages.
          A green accent colour highlights buttons, links, and interactive elements
          to give the site a fresh and modern appearance.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          Transparent, glass-style cards were used in sections such as Projects
          and Reviews to add visual depth while maintaining a minimal design.
          Hover effects were implemented using CSS only, enhancing user interaction
          without relying on animations or JavaScript.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr class="hr">

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Responsive Design</h2>
        <p class="p">
          Responsiveness was a key focus of this project.
          The website is designed to work well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
          CSS media queries, Grid, and Flexbox were used to ensure flexible layouts.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          On larger screens, content is displayed in multiple columns,
          while on smaller screens it automatically stacks into a single column.
          This ensures readability and prevents layout overflow.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          A CSS-only mobile navigation menu was created using a checkbox and label
          technique. On smaller screens, navigation links are hidden and replaced
          with a Menu button. When clicked, the menu expands vertically.
          This solution avoids JavaScript while still meeting assignment requirements.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr class="hr">

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Projects Section</h2>
        <p class="p">
          The Projects page consists of two main parts.
          The first section lists my interests, including artificial intelligence,
          machine learning, database management, and networking, using a simple grid layout.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          The second section displays four project templates in a scrollable layout.
          These templates are transparent, use a green theme, and can be scrolled or
          swiped on mobile devices. This adds interactivity while using only HTML and CSS.
          On larger screens, the cards adjust to fill the available space, providing
          a good user experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr class="hr">

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Reviews / Testimonials Section</h2>
        <p class="p">
          A Reviews section was added to the Home page to make the website feel
          more realistic and professional.
          This section includes testimonial cards written as feedback for a web
          developer or website designer.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          Each card contains a short review, name, role, and star rating.
          The reviews are displayed in a responsive grid layout:
          three columns on desktop, two on tablets, and one on mobile devices.
          This section improves the visual appeal and demonstrates structured
          content layout design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr class="hr">

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Contact Page</h2>
        <p class="p">
          The Contact page includes a simple form that uses the <code>mailto</code> method.
          When the form is submitted, the user’s default email application opens
          with the form data included.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          This approach was chosen because server-side scripting is outside the
          scope of this module. The form uses proper labels and input fields to
          ensure accessibility and usability, and the design remains consistent
          with the rest of the website.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr class="hr">

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Video Demonstration</h2>
        <p class="p">
          The Video Demo page contains an embedded video using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.
          The video demonstrates the website’s navigation, features, and responsiveness.
          Embedding the video directly allows it to play within the site instead
          of redirecting users to an external platform.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr class="hr">

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Validation and Testing</h2>
        <p class="p">
          All HTML and CSS files were validated using online validation tools to
          ensure there were no major syntax errors.
          Minor warnings were reviewed and corrected where necessary.
          Validation screenshots are included in this Site Report as required.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          The website was tested on different screen sizes using browser developer tools.
          Navigation links, forms, and interactive elements were checked to ensure
          they function correctly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr class="hr">

      <section>
        <h2 class="h1">Version Control and GitHub</h2>
        <p class="p">
          GitHub was used throughout the development process for version control.
          Regular commits were made with clear messages describing updates such as
          layout improvements, responsiveness fixes, and content additions.
          This demonstrates good development practice and provides evidence of
          continuous progress.
